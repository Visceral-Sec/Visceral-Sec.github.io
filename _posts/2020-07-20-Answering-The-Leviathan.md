### Answering the Leviathan
# Ethical challenges of cyber security professionals through the lens of social contract theory

Within this essay I aim to explore different ethical challenges that cyber security professionals face from the
perspective of social contract theory; namely Thomas Hobbs and his political work: Leviathan: Or the Matter,
Forme and Power of a Commonwealth, Ecclesiasticall and Civil.

Two ethical challenges I will present are:
- The multifaceted role of a chief information security officer *(CISO)* as an advisor to a mini-Leviathan
- State Leviathans and their fractured ethics on cyber security

I will begin to unpick these challenges through the lens of political and ethical philosophy and endeavour to
discuss any relevant questions and other secondary ethical challenges. I will start by introducing and applying
the concepts of Hobbesian social contract theory to the 2017 Equifax security breach case. Furthermore, I will
identify equivalences between the different roles defined in Leviathan and the responsibilities of chief
information security officers *(CISOs)*. Then through social contract theory, I will draw attention to the conflict
of interests in nation states towards cyber security and its surrounding ethics.
Hobbesian social contract theory describes the political philosophy written by Thomas Hobbs in the
influential piece: Levithan. Specifically, social contract theory, is defined as
“hypothetical compact, or agreement, between the ruled or between the ruled and their rulers, defining the rights and duties of each.”
*(“social contract | Definition, Examples, Hobbes, Locke, & Rousseau | Britannica,” n.d.)*. 

Hobbesian theory introduces the concept of a “Leviathan”, a political allegory for sovereignty. The term Leviathan represents two
major principles of a Hobbesian state: omnipotence and metaphysicality. The literal definition of Leviathan refers to the monstrous beast described in both Jewish and Christian scriptures. The west-minster assembly described the creature “
because by his bignesse he seemes not one single creature, but a coupling of divers together” *(Downame, 1645)*.

The implication that the Leviathan represented multiple beings: “he seems not
one single creature” correlates to the Hobbesian theory that sovereignty political power existed metaphysically,
as a social contract between the people and authority. Another implication is the unrivalled power of
sovereignty, just as the Leviathan is unparalleled in size, the power of authority is unquestionable. Hobbs
considered the power wielded by authority to be omnipotent and omnipresent due to the contract between the
people and the state. Hobbs stated that the Leviathan was a necessary requirement to prevent a “State of
Nature”, which is expanded upon further in the essay. In modern renditions and applications of Hobbesian
theory businesses are referred as “Mini-Leviathans” as they possess less authority that than of a state
*(Leviathan)*, but can internally function similarly. *(Da Silva, 2022)*

The mistakes and the fallout of the Equifax breach when applied in context of Hobbesian political theory
show underlying ethical challenges of Cyber Security. In 2017 Equifax suffered a serve data breach, resulting in
143 million Americans being affected. After investigation, it became known that the vulnerability that caused
the breach was reported to Equifax by the supplier two months in advance. Another major issue identified was
a poor standard of cyber security in Argentinian Branch *(Default Credentials)* which would have resulted in
14000 unencrypted employees' username, passwords, and national ID Numbers. *(Fruhlinger, 2020)*
In this case, I suggest the board of directors represent the “Leviathan” due to the influence they have in
business operations. In Hobbesian society a Leviathan’s main objective is to stably accumulate power. Da
Dilva, 2022 suggests that power can be considered in a modern context to be a business’s wealth and status.
Therefore, the board of directors represent the Leviathan, as similarly their main goal is the maximization of
profits. *(Da Silva, 2022)*. Furthermore, business ventures are decided by the board of directors, which suggests
a direct parallel to the sole authority used to describe Leviathans.

Hobbes discusses the value of “Counsellors” in a state leviathan. These men provide guidance and
recommendations and must have consistent interests of the counsel *(Paul, 2015)*. I suggest that Chief
Information Security Officers *(CISO)* positions play an equivalent role in modern Mini-Leviathans. Their
purpose is to manage the cyber security at a senior executive level and relay to the board of directors.
However, it is worth noting that unlike the Hobbesian representation of Counsellors, CISO are not exempt
from the decisions of the directors. Often CISO lose their jobs after the fallout of security breach *(Da Silva,
2022)*.

Da Silva also suggests that the CISO’s alternative role in a Mini-Leviathan, religious authority plays a similar
role. Hobbs, who was privately atheist, declared that religious authority was heavily respected by the Leviathan
due to social prevalence and importance placed upon religion.
“Who, that is in fear of Ghosts, will not bear great respect that drives them from him” *(Hobbes, 1985, p. 692)*. Hobbs identifies the believed church’s power over to drive “Ghosts” away, which represent a general fear in the population, as a key reason behind the church’s influence.

I question whether cyber security threats can symbolize modern “Ghosts” and cyber security professionals as
religious authorities. Cyber security to most non-technical executives may be daunting. Intimidating legislation
and worst-case scenarios are usually common first impressions of cyber security. Therefore, the conflicting
interests of religious bodies and counsellors in modern application of Hobbesian theory creates ethical
challenges. I question whether it is ethical for cyber security professionals to present a hyperbolic
representation of a business’s security to receive increased benefits. This challenge can be explored through
the application of different ethical frameworks such as Bentham utilitarianism and Kantian ethics. Both
frameworks demonstrate two opposing ethical interpretations hence their utilisation.

### Bentham Approach

Affected by Thomas Hobbs view on the nature of humanity, Jeremy Bentham held the belief that humans are
dedicated to two masters: Pleasure and Pain. To seek pleasure and avoid pain is at the root of Benthamism.
He states that:
“Nature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters, pain and pleasure.
It is for them alone to point out what we ought to do, as well as to determine what we shall do.” *(Bentham,
1789)*. Benthamism and alternative types of utilitarianism are consequential ethics which are intrinsically
based on two principles. These being, an act is considered right or wrong depended solely on the
consequences of an act and the more pleasure created by an act, the more righteous *(“BBC - Ethics -
Introduction to ethics,” n.d.)*. Thus, Benthamism theory argues that it is ethical to exaggerate cyber threats.
The benefit of increased cyber security would lead to more long-term benefit as the chance of being hacked is
reduced. Although, it is possible that increasing paranoia about cyber threat increases pain, but the benefit of
added security itself remedies this. It is important to mention that although cyber security is an imperative part
of a business’s infrastructure, inhibiting other parts of the businesses from operating effectively by utilizing
effectively stolen resources can create more pain than pleasure. Therefore, making the action unethical from a
Benthamism perspective *(Driver, 2014)*.

### Kantian Approach

Kantian Ethics are considered deontological; thus, the action rather than the consequence is judged *(Johnson
and Cureton, 2022)*. Immanuel Kant argued that all morality is underpinned by one principle: the categorical
imperative. The categorical imperative *(CI)* is a universally, rational, and unconditional principle which dictate
our moral duties. Correctness of an action depend only if they fulfil these duties; the consequences are not
relevant. The CI operates through three different formulations:

#### The Formula of Universal Law: 
As mentioned, Kant considered the CI universal, the first formulation
emphasises the importance of universality. “
Always act in such a way that you can also that the maxim of your
action should become a universal law” *(Kant, 1785)*. You must act where every action should become general
law for everyone else in the same situation, if your actions cannot be followed and applied to everyone equally
than it is not a valid ethical duty.

#### The Importance of Respect: 
Kant heavily believed in the importance of equality; all human beings should be treated as free and equal, as such the second formulation reflects this: “Act so that you treat humanity, both in your own person and in that of another, always as an end and never merely as a means” *(Kant, 1785)*. Kant expressed that people should be treated as an end in themselves, not to an end. People should not be tricked,
manipulated, or bullied.

#### The Importance of Duty: 
Kant’s final formulation demonstrates its deontological ethic:
“Do the right thing for the right reason because it is the right thing to do.” *(Kant, 1785)*. Kant stresses the importance of acting for the
correct reason. A common example is the importance of not committing a crime because of the moral duty rather than fearing the legal consequences. Kant’s final formulation underlines the importance of this.


Kantians usually apply two questions to determine the ethical implications of an action *(Anscombe, 2001)*: Can
I rationally propose everyone acts in this exact way? *(Formula of universal law)* and do these actions fully
respect the people involved? *(Importance of Duty and Respect)*. Some could argue that exaggerating cyber
threats is unethical, as to exaggerate involves using another person as means to an end which is direct violation
of second formulation. The universality of this action can also be called into question. For instance, focusing
too much on cyber security can potentially inhibit other parts of the business from receiving essential funding
for. However, it is worth noting that strict Kantian ethics may fail to incorporate issues where a utilitarianism
approach could be beneficial. For example, businesses which do not invest in cybersecurity may use
exaggeration as the only method of achieving a minimum amount of cyber security

Within Leviathan, Thomas Hobbs introduces two major concepts not yet discussed: the
“right of revolution” and the State of Nature” both of which are intrinsically interlinked. “On-Man” the first chapter of Leviathan
defines man as above animals but not above human-nature, capable of creating a common-wealth but incapable of restraining man’s self-interest. He elaborates by introducing the “state of nature” which in moral
and political philosophy equates to the hypothetical condition of humanity without political association *(“state of nature | Definition, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, & Social Contract | Britannica,” n.d.)*. Hobbes famously describes this state of nature as “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.” Due to Hobbes pessimistic view on
human nature, he argued that the sovereignty provided by an Levithan was in almost all cases preferable. The only exception to this, the only right of revolution, the people possessed was if the Leviathan was oppressive to the level of giving into its own ruthless humanity.

Throughout this essay only businesses *(mini leviathans)* have been addressed. Although Hobbesian concepts
apply equally to both leviathans, the goals of a business and a state differ. Specifically, although both states and
businesses require a level of cyber security, State leviathans have a fractured relationship. As mentioned
Hobbs considered a leviathan’s main purpose the accumulation of power, in some case cyber security can
impede upon this. The state of nature described by Thomas Hobbs through a modern lens can potentially describe cyberspace. Cyberspace is a loosely defined term which originated from William Gibson’s
Neuromancer *(1984)*, which he himself has defined as “Evocative and essentially meaningless”, the term now is used to describe the abstract sociological concept of the “Internet”; the online world that exists apart from reality. People are given an option to exist with any real-world ties. Although not an entire parallel, the lack of any political association within cyberspace equates it to a quasi-state of nature. Hackers and other types of malicious users utilize cyberspace for their own self-interests. I suggest that modern Leviathans inherently
oppose this as Hobbs argues the original purpose of the social contract formed between the Leviathan and the people is to prevent this state of nature.

In 2015, David Cameron proposed messaging applications that utilize end-to-end encryption were to be
banned *(Morris, n.d.)*. Cameron argued that the proposal was in response of suspected terrorists having a
means of safe communication due to messaging providers not providing UK security services access to
messages. Real-world state leviathans demonstrate this conflict in what is known as the “Crypto-Wars”. The
Crypto wars is the unofficial name given to the debate around attempts at governments to limit public and
foreign nations access to effective cryptography *(The Crypto Wars, 2014)*. Other examples include when the
Australian Federal Police *(AFP)* were given legal powers to bypass journalist protections *(Taylor, 2019)* and an
USA Attorney general stating “don’t give me that crap about security, just put the backdoors in the encryption”
*(Francisco, n.d.)*. However, state Leviathans do also encourage good cyber security such as the cyber essentials
scheme; the free guidance given by the NCSC *(National Cyber Security Centre)* *(“About Cyber Essentials,”
n.d.)*. These examples highlight the Leviathan’s conflicting ethics on cybersecurity.

Applying this dilemma to the two different ethical frameworks previously introduced; Kantian and
Benthamism quickly identify the two primary arguments that oppose and support the Leviathan’s approach.
Kantianism, as a deontological ethic, heavily oppose the Leviathan in reducing public freedom since doing so
uses people as means to an end, which is not in accordance with the second formulation. Conversely,
Benthamism is a more nuanced view. Utilitarians argue, as a consequential ethic, that it is entirely dependent
on how much pain or pleasure the proposals create. The proposal is deemed as unethical if and only if it leads
to slight improvement of state security and the weaken aspect is maliciously abused. Thus, more pain is
created than pleasure. Both ethics are the bases for crypto-war arguments. Those in favour of the proposals
argue that the reduction in freedom is needed to enable authority to reduce the state-of-nature and apprehend
those responsible. On the contrary, those against argue that it is against the human right of privacy, and it does
more harm than good *(“The second crypto war is not about crypto | Cqure,” n.d.)*. It is important to mention
that this a heavily simplified representation: to explore specifics would be out of scope of this essay

As a decisive point, addressing the challenge from the viewpoint of political philosophers such as Thomas
Hobbs and John Locke demonstrate different interpretations of the argument. Thomas Hobbs considered the
Leviathan’s authority to be unquestionable. He argued that tyranny was unavoidable for society to exist and to
avoid the state of nature, security from this threat was “The raison d’Ȭtre” of the state”*(Arendt, 1951)*.
Therefore, Hobbesian theory supports the Leviathan in reducing cyber security standards as it combats the
state-of-nature. Locke, however, argued for the existence of “inalienable” *(impossible to surrender)* natural
rights in a state. These natural rights: Life, Liberty, and property limited authority, as to encroach upon these
rights would constitute a revolution with fellow countrymen. Hence Lockean theory would argue that to inhibit
the people’s security standards is to encroach upon the natural rights and therefore would oppose the
Leviathan. Due to limitations, exploration of these ethical challenges from the perspective of Aristotelian
ethics has not considered. Additionally, exploration into the application of Rousseau’s “The Social Contract”
would have provided a wider ethical and political perspective.

In conclusion, viewing businesses and states through social contract theory enabled identification of the
multifaceted roles and challenges that cyber security professionals must undertake. Within businesses *(mini-
Leviathans)* CISO’s varied purposes resemble the concepts of the “Church” and the “Counsellor”. These roles
have conflicting interests which when explored present the first ethical challenge discussed. Nation states
*(Leviathans)* also possess a confliction in interests. The purpose of a Leviathan is to gain more power and
prevent a state-of-nature however to do so decreases the freedoms of the people. Translating this conflict from
social contract theory to the modern world relates to a pre-established ethical challenge of the crypto wars.
Through analyse of these challenges from different political and ethical philosophers accentuate the ethical
grey that cyber security and cyber security professionals occupy in business and state.
