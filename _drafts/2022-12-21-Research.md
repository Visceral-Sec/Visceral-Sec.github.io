# Background Information
This Section will cover the background research needed to understand the topic. Therefore, I will laying out the definitons of the main ideas that underpin the idea of Zarathrustra. Although I  briefly mentioned and defined this topics, this post should act as a glossary.


- Threats

Threats, in a cyber-security context, refers to the malicious act that intends to damage/steal data or disrupt system operation.

- Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/intrusion-detection-system-ids/
https://www.checkpoint.com/cyber-hub/network-security/what-is-an-intrusion-detection-system-ids/

Intrustion detection systems is a monitoring device that detects potential threats and generates alerts accordingly. They do not take any action on these alerts. Intrustion detection systems use multiple methods of detection.


- Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)
https://www.checkpoint.com/cyber-hub/network-security/what-is-ips/

Although functioning identically like intrusion detection systems, An IPS, Unlike intrustion detection systems, will take action on these alerts.


- Network Prevention/Detection Systems

IPS's and IDS will be focused torwards a specific sector of IT infrastructure. Network are IPS & IDS's that are designed around network traffic. Such as detecting network activity for potential IOCs (Indicators of compromise) and preventing them in the case of Prevention systems.

- Host Prevention/Detection Systems

Host IDS & IPS are instead focused on 

Host prevention/detection systems refer to IPS and IDS that operate on hosts machines. Host detection looks for IOCs in a host's operating system, user and network activity. Unlike network IPS/IDS which deals with all infrastructure communication, host IPS/IDS are specalised to a host.

- Anomaly
An anomaly: "A deviation from the common rule,type arrangement, or form". Within cyber-security and intrustion detection anomalies refer to deviations identfied by anomaly-based intrusion detection systems.

- Signature Based Prevention/Detection Systems
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/intrusion-detection-system-ids/

The term "signature-based" refers to type of method used by prevention/detection systems detect threats. Signature-based methods use a specific patterns (Signature) to identify threats. Signature-based IDS are effective at identifying pre-existing malware but new malware, an unknown signature, may not be detected.


- Anomalous Based Prevention/Detection Systems

The anomalous based method instead uses a baseline of "trusted" activity. All activity is then compared to this baseline, if activity doesn't match up the baseline then the activity is deemed an anomaly and therefore a potential threat. 

- Processes

An Process as a term describes the abstraction of a running program. Abstracting programs into proccess gives the operating system a manipulatable object. These running programs contain their own values such as program counters, registers and variables.The main purpose for this abstraction is for efficiency. Asbtracting these programs into individual processes allows for "context-switching" which is where the CPU switches it's execution to a different process. This allows for psudo-concurrent operation even on one CPU. . For example, one process makes a disk request (a lengthy endeavour) so it's more time effective to context switch into another process.

- Process runtime information.

Process runtime information is in reference to information that describes a process. An example could be the command that originally started the process.
It's important to note that i've used the synonymous terms: "Process diagnostics" and "process metadata" throughout my development commentary. 

linux provides methods to probe the operating system to gather this information, such as the proc virtual file system. This virtual file system details all the different active processes on a system and runtime information.

- Binary Exploitation
https://dmz.torontomu.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Binary-Exploitation-201.pdf

Binary exploitation refers to exploiting a bug or vulnerability within a program in order to cause unintended and usually malicious behaviour in a program.

- Machine-Learning
https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/machine-learning

Machine-learning, a branch of Artifical Intelligence, is the utlization of data and algorithms to imitate learning. These algorithms can learn and adapt without explicit instruction and therefore being able to draw inferences and analyse data over-time. 

- Regression Models

Within machine-learning, there are mulitple methods of investigating relationships within data. One of these is Regression. Regression can be used to predict contious outcomes based on the behaviour of previous data. Regression predictions are thereofore quantifiable.

- Classification Models

Classification is a alternative method of investigating relationships. classification attempts to predict what the data's classification. Unlike regression, classification is unquantifable as it aims to classify rather than predict.

- Zarathrustra 

Zarathrustra, my project, aims to reduce the scope of Intrusion prevention systems even further to process level. Taking an anomalous-based intrusion detection, in order to classify process activity using a baseline (created by process run time information). Identifying a process's activity can provide an method of identifying program threats (binary exploitation).

# Fore Ground Information
### Types of Process Runtime information
I think it's a safe assumption to say that operating systems are the most complex class of programs. Handling processes, I/O, networking, memory management as well as a whole host of smaller systems. How these process are handled it iself comes with a plethora of complexity. Processes need to be able to perform a variety of different tasks and it's up to the operating system to provide processes methods of achieving them. The methods provided to a process are known as [systemcalls](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-system-call/). The system calls used by a process is one of the different types of process runtime information that zarathrustra will collect. This section will outline the different types of information that can be gathered from proccesess.

Samhina Labs Development details some interesting process activity:
- Process Check: Samhain can optionally check for processes that are hidden and to check for the existense of required processes.

The module works by searching the complete range of possible PIDs for processes, and comparing the list of processes thus found against the output of ps. Note that the range of possible PIDs is OS-specific, and in general must be configured by the user (except for Linux, where it is determined automatically). ---> Interesting.

PIDs are a set range. Interesting.
